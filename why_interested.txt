Hi everyone! My name is Siva Akash Ramini. I'm a Full-time Master's Data Science student. I'm from Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India. From this course I'm looking to Explore new stuff in the field of data Science and gain knowledge and expertise to eliminate Human-effort and introduce machines to do our work. I have completed my bachelor's in India a few months ago, and looking forward to this new journey!
